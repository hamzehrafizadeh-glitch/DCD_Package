10- SIF: 
I Have To Check The Correctness Of The Field In The Package, K[q] and Kminus[q] for each inclusions are calculated in this file. k and  kminus show SIF i and ii (mode I and II) for RHS and LHS of the inclusion respectively.

11- PackageManipulations: 
(* :Author:Leonid B.Shifrin*)The package provides tools to (dynamically) re-load, clear and/or remove the context of any loaded package (optionally with sub-contexts) during interactive Mathematica session or during execution of a stand-alone program. These operations are performed respecting the general package mechanics in Mathematica.Additional functionality includes (optional) automatic resolving of shadowing problems that may have occured before or during reloading,and tracking escaping symbols 

#####################File Boundary Element Method:###################

1- GenerateMesh: Boundary discretization. Save XY matrix in XY.dat file.
2- FieldsBE:     Base solution Stress and displacement fields.
3- CoefMat:      Produce coefficient matrixes Uij and Cij. Save Uij and Cij matrix in Uij.dat and Cij.dat files.

6-               Solve Sij.W = s and find W as weight function vector. Save W vectore in W.dat file.
7-FieldsXY:      Substitute W in the new matrix of Uij(x,y) and Cij(x,y) and finding fields using Uij(x,y).W 
                 and Cij(x,y).W.

#############################File run:##############################

CombinMMBE:
In this file a tangential stress field caused by the grain boundary on the premier of 
the qth inclusion is calculated. This function will be used to find a correct propagation direction in eta0 function in the run2 file.

run0:
In this file stress fields of the system are calculated using the multipole 
method. Then, by using the correct coefficients and removing regular fields 
(by equating Eta_nmpq and Mu_nmpq ), stress fields can be calculated at any point 
in the model.

run1: 
This file produces two matrixes of expansion coefficients; eta and mu.


run02:
This file calculates the stress fields caused by the inclusions on the points of the mesh of the grain boundary. This information (SMM) will be used as the supplementary boundary condition for BE method.
Then, change expansion coefficient to the original values and combine BE and MM by loading CombinMMBE file. 

run2: 
In this file by using maximum tangential stress criterion, coordinates of the new propagated inclusion is found.The new coordinate is saved in the output file. It automatically updates the output file.

run3: 
In this file path propagation of an inclined inclusion is calculated.The path propagation is predicted by just adding crack/inclusion and recalculating stress fields between cracks/inclusions. 
 
run4: 
In this file path propagation of an inclined inclusion is calculated. The path propagation is predicted by finding an equivalent crack/inclusion and recalculating stress fields between cracks/inclusions. 

run5: 
This file reads output1 and calculates crack propagation path.

run1EtaMu0: 
Using this file, the full stress field of the system can be calculated.
