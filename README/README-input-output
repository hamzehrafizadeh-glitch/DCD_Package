n= It defines the total number of harmonic terms for accuracy of the calculations.

num1 = Crack propagation criterion. Number 1, is the to search on the surface of inclusion for max energy, number 2 uses SIFs.

num2 = It determines which process has to be used to calculate SIF; 1 is the formula from MM, 2 is the average SIF over short distance.

ntot = Total number of inclusions in the system.

Nu0 = Poisson ratio for the host material
Mu0 = Shear modulus for the host material 

(uniform farfield)
s11
s12
s22

NuQ = Poisson ratio for the inclusions (ntot terms, ntot = number of inclusions )
MuQ = Shear modulus for the inclusions (ntot terms)

l1 = Major axis of elliptical inclusions (ntot terms)
l2 = Minor axis of elliptical inclusions (ntot terms)
teta = Inclusion’s orientation [-90,90](ntot terms)
teta1 = Inclusion’s orientation [0,360](ntot terms)
zcender = (x+Iy) centre point of each inclusions in global coordinate system.
zcendernew = centre point of each new created inclusions in global coordinate system.

input file provides an input numbers for package1 and contains information and it contains primitive information of system geometry and properties.
